// CameraPreview — a self-contained live-preview widget for the Settings dialog.
//
// Owns a child static window (created from the IDC_PREVIEW control in the
// dialog template and subclassed so we can paint it ourselves), a dedicated
// worker thread that blocks on the camera's FrameReady auto-reset event, and a
// DIB section the worker writes converted BGRA into while WM_PAINT blits from.
//
// Threading model:
//   * Public methods (Attach/Detach/SetCamera/SetControllerArray) are called
//     on the dialog (UI) thread only.
//   * The worker thread owns _source and writes converted BGRA into the DIB
//     under an exclusive SRWLOCK (held only for the ~1ms write). WM_PAINT
//     reads the DIB under a shared SRWLOCK (held only for the StretchBlt) so
//     it never sees a half-written frame. The worker also refreshes an _inUse
//     atomic for the badge so the UI thread never touches _source.
//
// A single DIB section is sufficient: the exclusive/shared SRWLOCK pair already
// guarantees tear-free reads, so a second buffer and an atomic front-index
// swap would buy nothing but extra GDI churn.
//
// Zero-overhead guarantee: when the dialog is closed, Detach() signals the
// worker, joins it, tears down the DIB, and clears the preview-hold flag on
// the camera. No thread, no Reader mapping, no held camera survives.
