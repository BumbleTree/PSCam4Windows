# PSCam4Win — PlayStation cameras as Windows Virtual Cameras (Windows 11 Only)

PSCam4Win lets you use classic PlayStation cameras as standard web cameras (and audio inputs) on modern Windows 11 systems. It currently supports the **PlayStation 3 Eye** and the **PlayStation 2 EyeToy**, behind one common user-space pipeline.

Once installed, each plugged-in camera appears to apps like **Discord, Zoom, OBS, PCSX2 / RPCS3, and web browsers** as a regular built-in camera, named after the device that occupies the slot (e.g. **"PS3 Eye"** or **"PS2 EyeToy"**). The integrated microphones are also exposed as standard recording devices named **"USB Camera-B4.09.24.1"** (for the PS3 Eye's 4-channel array) and **"Logitech EyeToy USB Camera"** (for the PS2 EyeToy). Everything operates in user space (no risky kernel drivers — only Microsoft's inbox WinUSB for video) and is fully safe for Memory Integrity / Core Isolation settings.

> **Device support:** PS3 Eye streams raw Bayer that is debayered to YUY2 in-process; the PS2 EyeToy (OmniVision OV519/OV7648) streams JPEG over WinUSB isochronous and is decoded to YUY2 with libjpeg-turbo. Both ride the same FrameBus → virtual-camera path. PS4/PS5 cameras are planned.

(The PS2 EyeToy follows the same right-hand path: its JPEG iso stream is reassembled and
 decoded to YUY2 in PSCam4WinTray.exe, then published to its own Global\PSCam4Win{N}.FrameBus.
 Its microphone is also automatically driver-mapped via usbaudio.sys to "Logitech EyeToy USB Camera".)

## What It Does For You

* **Connect Up to 8 Cameras:** Use up to 8 PlayStation cameras (any mix of PS3 Eye and PS2 EyeToy) at the same time. The virtual cameras appear in your apps automatically only when a physical camera is plugged in, named after whichever device occupies the slot, and disappear when unplugged so you never see clutter.
* **Smart Sleep & Wake:** The physical cameras automatically power down (turning off the red LED and using 0% CPU) when not in use by any app, and wake up instantly when needed.
* **Integrated Microphone Support:** Works seamlessly with the built-in microphones of both devices: the PS3 Eye's 4-channel microphone array (**"USB Camera-B4.09.24.1"**) and the PS2 EyeToy microphone (**"Logitech EyeToy USB Camera"**) are both automatically exposed as standard Windows recording devices.
* **Quick Control from System Tray:** Adjust camera settings easily via a menu right next to your Windows clock.
* **Auto-Saved Settings:** Your adjustments for mirroring, gain, exposure, and white balance are automatically remembered for each camera.
* **Silent Windows Startup:** Launches quietly when you log in without showing any annoying security prompts.
* **No Complicated Setup:** You don't need to manually configure drivers or download third-party tools like Zadig—the installer does everything for you.

## How to Install & Uninstall

### Installation
1. Make sure you have built the binaries (run `build.bat` first if you are compiling from source).
2. Right-click [install.bat] and choose **Run as administrator** (or double-click it and accept the prompt).
3. The installer will:
   * Upgrade any older **PS3EyeVCam** install in place (migrating your saved per-camera settings, then removing the old app, task, and registration).
   * Copy files to `C:\Program Files\PSCam4Win` (required for system camera integration).
   * Install the WinUSB video drivers for both the PS3 Eye and the PS2 EyeToy automatically.
   * Register the Virtual Camera DLL (handling all 8 camera CLSIDs).
   * Create an Add/Remove Programs entry in the Windows Registry.
   * Set up a silent logon task to launch the control tray app at Windows startup.
   * Launch the system tray controller.

### Uninstallation
If you want to cleanly remove it from your system:
1. Double-click [uninstall.bat] (or run the copy inside `C:\Program Files\PSCam4Win`).
2. It will stop the services, delete scheduled tasks, remove registry entries (including the Add/Remove Programs entry), remove both video drivers, unregister all CLSIDs, clean up the certificates, and delete all copied files.

## Using the Camera and Settings

### Accessing Settings
Once installed, look for the **PS3 Eye camera icon** in your Windows System Tray (near the clock).
<img width="401" height="174" alt="SystemTray" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/694ab46e-8f88-4642-b00e-b44de9beb11a" />

* **Right-click the tray icon** to:
  * Open **Settings** (or double-click the icon).
  * Toggle **Start with Windows** on/off.
  * Exit the tray application.
* **Settings Dialog**:
  * Choose which camera to configure using the **Camera dropdown selector** (independent settings are loaded and persisted per camera).
  * Adjust **Gain**, **Exposure**, **Brightness**, **Contrast**, **Sharpness**, **Hue**, **Red/Blue/Green Balance** manually via sliders in real time.
  * Toggle **Auto Gain & Exposure** and **Auto White Balance**.
  * Enable **Test Pattern** output for debugging or virtual camera validation.
  * Set **Video Presets** (e.g., standard 640×480 @ 60fps up to 75fps, or high-speed 320×240 up to 187fps).
  * Enable **Mirroring** (horizontal or vertical flip).
<img width="376" height="420" alt="camera settings (1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71843b34-0c2c-494c-b3e3-68eac5a2a482" />


*Note: If a program is currently streaming video from the selected camera, mode/preset changes for that camera are queued and will automatically apply as soon as you close/restart the stream.*

### Setting up with Emulators (e.g., RPCS3)
1. Ensure the tray app is running (check your system tray).
2. Open **RPCS3** and go to **Settings** > **I/O**.
3. Set **Camera Handler** to **Qt** and select **PS3 Eye (Windows Virtual Camera)** as the device.
4. Ensure camera access is allowed under Windows Settings (*Privacy & security* > *Camera* > *Allow desktop apps to access your camera*).
5. For microphone support in RPCS3 or PCSX2, go to the emulator's audio settings, configure the microphone handler (e.g., **USBD** or standard Windows audio input), and select the appropriate recording device (**USB Camera-B4.09.24.1** for PS3 Eye, or **Logitech EyeToy USB Camera** for PS2 EyeToy).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Camera missing in apps | Check if the tray icon is present and has a green status. |
| Tooltip says "camera not detected" | Try unplugging and replugging the USB cable. The app will automatically find the camera once connected. |
| Apps show black screen | The camera takes ~1 second to wake up from sleep mode. Wait a moment; if it stays black, ensure the tray app is running. |
| Settings status shows registration fail | Go to Windows Settings > Privacy & security > Camera and ensure "Allow desktop apps to access your camera" is enabled. |

## Performance, Latency & Resources

* **Ultra-Low Latency:** Delivers video frames instantly to your apps with no noticeable delay or lag.
* **High Framerates:** Supports standard 60 FPS (up to 75 FPS) at 640×480, and high-speed modes up to 187 FPS at 320×240.
* **Minimal CPU Impact:** Highly optimized video processing uses negligible CPU, even in high-speed modes.
* **Zero Idle Resource Usage:** When no apps are using the camera, the background system uses 0% CPU and puts the camera into low-power mode.

## Architecture & Technical Notes (For Developers)

### Multi-Camera Routing
* The host daemon spawns an independent thread for each physical camera `i` (0 to 7) mapped dynamically. 
* Each thread registers a virtual camera using the static class ID `CLSID_PS3EyeVCams[i]` (GUIDs retained across the rebrand to avoid COM re-registration), and communicates over custom slot-specific IPC channels: `Global\PSCam4Win[i].FrameBus` and `Global\PSCam4Win[i].Control`. The friendly name shown to apps is chosen per slot from the occupying device's profile.
* The virtual camera registers (`IMFVirtualCamera`) dynamically *only* when a physical camera is connected to a slot, and unregisters it on removal. This ensures client applications see exactly the number of cameras physically plugged in. Camera arrival and removal are event-driven via WinUSB device interface notifications fanned out to per-slot controllers (with a 5-second polling fallback for empty slots).

### High-Performance IPC (FrameBus)
* **Sub-Millisecond Latency via Auto-Reset Events:** Video frames are passed from the capture thread to the virtual camera DLL via a lock-free shared-memory queue (`FrameBus`). The reader waits on a per-camera auto-reset event (`Global\PSCam4Win[N].FrameReady`) with restricted ACLs rather than polling or sleeping, avoiding the 15.6 ms system timer quantum. This allows high-speed modes (100–187 fps) to achieve their full target framerate with sub-millisecond latency.
* **Sleep/Wake Coordination:** Sleep/wake state is coordinated via a shared keepalive timestamp (`common\ControlBus.h`). If the virtual camera DLL stops requesting frames, the tray app puts the hardware to sleep after ~3 seconds.

### On-the-Fly Image Processing & Color Conversion
* **Fused Debayering Pipeline:** To minimize CPU and memory footprint, `ps3eye.cpp` uses a fused single-pass Bayer-to-YUY2 debayering pipeline that outputs directly to BT.601 YUY2 via a 1.9 KB cache-resident row scratch buffer, completely bypassing the need for a 1.2 MB BGRA intermediate buffer.
* **Native Original Format, On-Demand Conversion:** The shared-memory frame buffer carries `YUY2` (YUYV 4:2:2) — the PS3 Eye's original output format — preserving the sensor's full vertical chroma resolution end to end. A client requesting `YUY2` (such as the RPCS3 emulator) receives the camera frame byte-for-byte with no conversion at all; clients using the modern `NV12` format get a proper chroma-averaged 4:2:2 → 4:2:0 conversion performed on the fly at delivery time.
* **On-Demand Scaling:** When the camera preset and the application's requested resolution mismatch (e.g., camera is capturing at 320x240 but Discord requests 640x480), the DLL scales 2x on the fly: bilinear interpolation when upscaling and a 2x2 box filter when downscaling, both in integer math in well under a millisecond (negligible CPU usage even at 187 FPS). No scaling is performed when the formats match.
* **Optimized Bandwidth:** In high-speed 320x240 modes, raw data is sent across the memory bus at just 29 MB/s. Scaling occurs within the client process on-demand, saving system memory bandwidth.

### USB Bandwidth & Device Configuration
* **USB Bandwidth Bottlenecks:** Each PS3 Eye camera requires ~185 Mbps of USB bandwidth at 640x480 @ 60 FPS. Although modern PCs use USB 3.x (xHCI) ports, the PS3 Eye is a USB 2.0 High-Speed device and is restricted to the USB 2.0 protocol layer, which shares a 480 Mbps bandwidth pool on the controller's High-Speed bus. A single physical controller can therefore support at most 2 cameras before saturating the bus. To run 3 to 8 cameras concurrently, you must distribute the cameras across separate USB controllers (e.g., separating them between rear motherboard ports, front panel ports, or dedicated PCIe USB expansion cards).
* **Composite Device Mapping:** Both the PS3 Eye and the PS2 EyeToy are composite USB devices. For both cameras, Interface 0 (`MI_00`) handles video streaming (via WinUSB and the tray app), while Interface 1 (`MI_01`) is automatically handled by the standard Windows USB Audio driver (`usbaudio.sys`) to expose their respective microphones.

### System Integration & OS Details
* **Security & Permissions:** The virtual camera media source DLL (`PSCam4Win.dll`) runs inside the **Camera Frame Server service** (`LOCAL SERVICE`). The tray app requires admin rights to create IPC objects in the `Global\` kernel namespace.
* **Startup Task:** The startup task uses the `ITaskService` COM API instead of `schtasks.exe` to bypass battery limits and execution duration limits.
